       The ARTIST Methodology is a modernization and migration solution that covers a wide range of application types, regardless of the underlying technologies, business models, operational modes, etc. In order to practically support this methodology, a central component will be incorporated in the overall architecture: the ARTIST Methodology Process Tool. This tool allows the customization and instantiation of the methodology based on the specific application requirements.<br />
				<br />
 		
       The objective of the ARTIST Methodology Process Tool is to allow the customization and instantiation of the ARTIST Migration Methodology for end-users based on the Migration Assessment results of the particular migration project. The Methodology Process Tool, exploiting the results processed and obtained during the assessment, defines a customized modernisation process, tailored to the concrete legacy application needs. The tool shows the customized process in detail, its tasks broken down step-by-step, including hooks to invoke the tools required to accomplish each task acting as an umbrella for ARTIST tools and frameworks.
