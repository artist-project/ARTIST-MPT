ARTIST MPT (Based on SpikesTogether), Version 1.0.0

=================================

ABOUT
-----
Complementary to the previous implementations, a SpikesTogether-based approach is also 
being implemented. Whereas the other approaches are focused towards technical users, this 
one is more accessible towards business users. SpikesTogether  is developed on top of 
SharePoint , a well-known web-based business collaboration platform. SpikesTogether is a 
tool facilitating the development of line-of-business (LoB) solutions, extending the core 
functionality of SharePoint in particular key aspects.
