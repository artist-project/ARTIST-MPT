   <intro>
      <description>
         This task is focused on the adaptation and creation of new roles in the organization due to the new business model. It is essential to define the roles and responsibilities within the organisation in order to cover all the activities created with the new business model. If new roles are necessary, these roles should have assigned activities and responsibilities, and those should be known by the people involved.
