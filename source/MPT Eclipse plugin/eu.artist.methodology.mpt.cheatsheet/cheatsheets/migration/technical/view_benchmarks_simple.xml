   <intro>
      <description>
         <b>The purpose of this Web Interface is to enable end users (application developers, Cloud customers, Cloud providers) to check, visualize and rank the actual performance of Cloud resources against real-world benchmarks targeted at specific application categories. Thus a suitable selection of the most promising resource may be performed.</b>

      <description>
         <b>Indicate the time period you are interested in. This may be helpful in case one wants to compare based on a specific time period (e.g. only recent results), to check the evolution of the results in time or in specific cases (e.g. weekend performance).</b>

      <description>
         <b>Indicate the benchmark test for which they are interested (e.g. DB, Mapreduce etc.). Based on each test’s details and setup, more information may be requested, for example for what type of DB (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB etc.) and for what type of workload.</b>
