      title="Reverse Engineering from existing system - Perform model discovery">
   <intro>
      <description>
         <b>Quick process to obtain, from the input legacy system and composing artifacts, the initial set of models required for the remainder of the process. Realized thanks to the ARTIST MDT (Model Discovery Toolbox) and its various components supporting both the Java/JEE and C#/.NET environments.</b>

         <b>Study the existing system to be reverse engineered (and then later migrated) in order to identify the kinds of software artifacts to be considered as inputs of the process, and also the corresponding discovery support that is going to be needed.<br/><br/>For help and support to this manual activity, the taxonomy of artifacts proposed in ARTIST can be consulted at:</b>

         <b>Perform the actual injection of the useful content from the previously identified software artifacts in order to produce the initial models. This is performed, depending of the considered environment, by using one or several model discoverers. To be performed several times using different discovery components depending on the types of software artifacts to be treated.</b>
