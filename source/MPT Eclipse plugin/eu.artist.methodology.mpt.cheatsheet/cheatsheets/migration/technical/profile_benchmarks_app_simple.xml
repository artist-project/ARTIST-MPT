         <b>Profiling tool is used: (1) In order to acquire the footprints of an unknown application or one of its components, on a specific physical host. The footprints consist of average execution metrics concerning CPU, RAM, disk and network utilization, and (2) in order to acquire the same type of footprints of a set of test-applications called benchmarks on the same physical host. The results of both execution modes of the tool, will be served as an input to a classification tool, which will decide upon the type of the application. Application types are defined according to the categorization of the benchmarks.</b>
