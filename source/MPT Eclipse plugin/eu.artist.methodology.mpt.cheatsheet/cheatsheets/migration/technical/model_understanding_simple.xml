         <b>Understand and transform the discovered models in the previous step. This task relies on the use of various (chains of) model-to-model transformations from the previously obtained low-level initial models to the final derived models to be provided as inputs of the Modernization tasks. These derived models may conform to different metamodels and so represent “views” on the legacy system at different levels of abstraction, according to the requirements of the next tasks.</b>

         <b>Transform the previously obtained models into more refined ones, thus producing higher level views on the initially treated legacy artefacts. Potentially iterative.</b>
