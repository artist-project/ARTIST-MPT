         <description>
            Define the pricing strategy taking into consideration each customer segment.  There are several possible license models.
o	By subscription
o	By use
o	By transaction
o	By value
o	Flat rate
o	Hybrid
The most appropriate one for being cloud compliant are: by use or by transaction. Based on the license model different parameters should be measured. These parameters could be:
o	Time: the time that the client uses the service measured in hours, seconds or microseconds.
o	Volume: The volume of the used service: GB, MB/s, CPU cycles, etc.
o	Sessions: number of accesses to the service
o	Requests: number of requests to the system
o	Users: number of users that are allowed to access to the system

            title="Define the billing mechanisms">
         <description>
            Based on the pricing strategy selected, different aspects of the application and the infrastructure will have to be monitored. These monitored aspects will be collected and through the billing component, billed to the end user. The billing component must offer also the possibility to decide on the frequency your customer wants to receive its bill.
