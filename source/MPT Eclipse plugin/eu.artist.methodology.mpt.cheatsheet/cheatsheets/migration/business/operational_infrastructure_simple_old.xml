      <description>
         In order for a SaaS application to run, some key infrastructure resources need to be identified. These resources can be distinguished between infrastructure and 3rd party services:

.- The infrastructure resources can be either related to a public cloud or on a private one. You should have by now identified the target cloud provider and their offer. In the case a public provider is selected, the pricing model of the target provider must be collected. In addition to that, a mechanism to account the cloud provider must be updated / created. In the case a private provider is selected, you must consider the operational costs of running such an infrastructure (personnel, licenses, hardware, etc.)

.- 3rd party services (e.g. monitoring components, billing components, etc) and the functionalities provided by them must be determined. The pricing model of these components must also be analysed and identified. These 3rd party components must also have SLA’s defined so that they can be monitored and request compensation in the case it is needed. Thus you need to define a mechanism to account for these components.

         Seek and establish an agreement with partners that can act as part of a sales network in markets that cannot reached with the sales channels you have already implemented.

         title="Establish Key infrastructure associations">
      <description>
         This step is devoted to establishing an agreement with the cloud provider on which your application is (will be) deployed as well as with the 3rd party components used within the application (if any). This agreement must include topics such as its price strategy, advantages, differentiated SLAs, etc.
