         title="Determine sales channels">
      <description>
         These customer relationship involves also the determination of the sales channels. 

The question that needs to be answered is: How will the customers contract the service?

Thus, depending on the type of service and the customer segment, the channels may differ. For instance, a different telephone number for different media support (one for the radio, another for TV, another for the internet).  The channels can include the software provider’s website, telephone, commercial network, etc.
