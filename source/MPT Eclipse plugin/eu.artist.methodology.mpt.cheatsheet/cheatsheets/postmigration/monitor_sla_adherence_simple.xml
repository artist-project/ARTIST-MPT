         <b>3ALib is a Java executable that may be used in the post-migration phase for the Cloud user to monitor the SLA adherence of their availability-based SLAs. The library is abstracted and follows the provider’s definition of availability, in their respective SLA, thus it can be used for compensation purposes claims.</b>
