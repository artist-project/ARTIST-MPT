ABOUT
-----
The MPT WebApp is a Java Server Faces (JSF) web application that runs on a web server, 
such as Apache Tomcat, and is packaged as a WAR file (eu.artist.methodology.mpt.webapp.war). 
This web application works in conjunction with the MPT Eclipse plug-in with the aim of 
guiding the user through the ARTIST migration process. It enables a user to upload and share
 pre-migration results with other people working on the project and uses them to configure 
 and visualize the ARTIST methodology through the EPF Composer.It has been implemented 
 using Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers, Version: Kepler Service Release 2, and 
 has been tested against Apache Tomcat v7. All required Java libraries are included 
 inside the distributed WAR.
